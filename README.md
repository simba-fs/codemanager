OK--a convenient tool for git
-----------------------------
it's a tiny to for git  
contain{  
	`git add .`    
	`git commit [message]`    
	`git push [repository]`   
}
it will work if you only use `ok`  
say goodbey to the ** long long long command ** if you think so like me  
**enjoy this tool**  
---

* `ok [message] [repository]`  
   ^^^  the onle function of this project  
---  
I think I'll add some function in this project if I can.  
You guys can help me finish it too.  
To tell the true, I don't have much time on it.  
But I do my best.
